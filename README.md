# BRAINPI

A Node JavaScript MVC Framework

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need to have both Node & NPM Running on your machine.

To verify your installation of Node, open your command line and run:

```
$ node -v
```

If you get a response similar to:

```

```

Then you're all set.

To verify your installation of NPM, open your command line and run:

```
$ npm -v
```

If you get a response similar to:

```
6.4.1
```

Then you're all set.

### Installing

A step by step series will help you install & get ready to start building your BrainPI Application.
